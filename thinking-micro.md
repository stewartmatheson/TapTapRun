# Thinking Micro

Microservices a great. As a concept their idea is simple. Don't write a monolith. Write smaller servcies. Write these services in what ever language you like. Shoot them like cattle when they are not working. Rewrite them when you feel like it. While all this is true there are some principals that should not be neglected.

## Principal 1
Microservices should not depend on each other. They should operate on their own.

## Principal 2
Client applications need to adopt a error first design

## Principal 3 
Services should own their data
